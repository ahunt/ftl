# FTL ("Fit Test Logger")

This is a very hacky proof of concept, and entirely unvalidated, fit-testing
application. This codebase is extremely messy.

## Setup guide

TODO: write this.

## Architecture

Actual test machinery will live in libp8020a. FTL is just a (not so) nice (yet)
GUI wrapper around that; in due time FTL will (probably) take care of test
logging.

There is no real architecture to speak of, yet.
